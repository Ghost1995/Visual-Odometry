# Visual-Odometry

**Problem Statement**

Frames from a driving car, and scripts to extract intrinsic parameters are given and the output should be a plot for the trajectory of the camera.

**Running the Code**

To run the code, first get all the images into the centre folder and then run the Project_2.m script.

This script will generate the output with visualization at every step. It will also generate a video in the output folder.

If you do not want to create video, comment out the lines 58 - 61, 107, and 113 in Project_2.m. (decreases the running time by 1 hour)

If you do not want to visulaize the output, comment out the lines 38 - 61, 89 - 107, and 113 in Project_2.m. (decreases the running time by 4 hours)

If you do not want to save the final output, comment out the lines 116 - 136 in Project_2.m.

**Output**

An example output is shown in the output folder.
